1 kHz link to the STM32, for the Pi side.

nexus_proto.py defines the bytes; this file makes sure none of them are missed.

The STM32 puts a complete state packet on the wire every millisecond whether
anyone is listening or not. USB does not drop them - they queue up in a kernel
buffer. So the only way to lose 1 kHz data on the Pi is to read too slowly, and
a control loop running at 250 Hz reading one packet per step does exactly that:
it falls three packets further behind every step, forever.

The fix is to decouple reading from using. A background thread does nothing but
drain the port, so reception stays at 1 kHz regardless of what the policy is
doing. The policy then asks for the newest packet and ignores the rest.

    link = NexusLink('/dev/ttyACM0')
    link.start()

    while True:                      # policy at 250 Hz
        pkt = link.latest()
        if pkt is not None and pkt.fusion_usable:
            action = policy(build_obs(pkt))
            link.send_command(action_to_turns(action))

Discarding packets here is not a loss - it is the point. The newest packet is
the only one that is not already out of date. If you also want every packet
(logging, system identification, plotting), turn on the history buffer and call
drain(); reception is 1 kHz either way.
